	<b><i>God is love, and all who live in love live in God, and God lives in them. The entire passage found in 1 John 4:7-21 speaks of God's loving nature. Love is not merely an attribute of God, it is part of his very makeup. God is not merely loving; at his core, he is love. God alone loves in the completeness and perfection of love. Love comes from God.<br><br></i></b>
